# Project: Jobly

## Overview
This application, Jobly is a React front-end for my Jobly backend where users can sign up/log in, view a list of companies and a list of jobs in each company, search for jobs, and apply for it. All data is coming from [Jobly_Backend](https://github.com/mariered0/43_Jobly-backend)).
This application can be viewed at [jobly_marieh.surge.sh](https://jobly_marieh.surge.sh/).
